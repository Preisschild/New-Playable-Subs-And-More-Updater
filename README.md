<br>
New Playable Subs & More Updater is a semi-auto updater for the <a href="https://github.com/CaptainX3/CW-Playable-Subs/">Playable Subs & More Mod</a>, a mod the the game <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/541210/Cold_Waters/">Cold Waters</a>. New Playable Subs & More Updater is designed so you can update your mod at the click of a button, without having to re-download the entire mod. If you have any issues please open an issue on the GitHub page and I will see to it as soon as possible.

#### How to install
See that bright green button on the right hand side of the page? The one that says "Clone or download". Click that, then choose "Download ZIP". Once downloaded open the folder and double click on "installer.bat". This will guide you through installation and will automatically install the New Playable Subs & More Updater for you.

#### Warning
If you have an anti virus it might mark the program as suspicious, due to the fact that I have used batch (.bat) to develop this. You should be able to override it and execute the installer.bat
